Description:  Sounds for the model Eva-01, which was done by
		Ionized Kit (a.k.a. [EVA]Rei III)

Build Time:  4-5 hours over a 2 day period.  Yes, I know that's
	long...but I'm a huge procrastinator, so you know how
	it is.  :)

===============================================================

Other info:  All sounds are from the Evangelion series.
Several are from the same sample, I just cut and altered pieces
from it. I didn't make the orginal sounds myself, nor was I the
orginal person to record the samples from the actual movie/show.
In all honesty, I took them from a few fan websites of
Evangelion, which I have their links down below.

This is my first attempt at making/editing some sounds.
Any feedback would be appreciated.

Editor's Note:  I didn't include the drown1.wav file, because
it didn't seem to work when you would drown in the water.

Don't really mind what you do with the sound FILES (ie edit it
all you want) as long as you mention me when you do (I may not
have recorded the sounds, but I spent a long while editing them
).  I would prefer it be distributed only with the Eva-01 model,
and as long as this txt file is included.
